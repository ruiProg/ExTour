We encountered lot of pitfalls along the journey and in this session I am planning to share my experiences on migrating legacy back-ends to Serverless and how to plan parallel migrations avoiding long waiting release cycles.</span></p>",

It's exciting to see testing happen at such a large scale. However there is an issue, it is too difficult for humans to deal with all the data being generated or analyze all the results from the testing. To deal with this the OpenStack community has developed and deployed several tools to help deal with the torrent of data. Using and building off these tools have been invaluable especially as the OpenStack project continues to grow. This talk will explain the basics of OpenStack's CI infra and cover the approach and tooling used by the OpenStack community to interact with the large amount of test result. It will explain the techniques used and the benefits derived from having both open test result data and performing analysis on that data to understand the project.</span></p>",

The work has been done in association with a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) called SAHI,  Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired which is part of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. SAHI supports the hearing impaired kids for Cochlear implant surgery so that the kids audibility increases. After the surgery audio therapy is given to kids for better understanding of the surrounding world. By using free and open source web applications, MIT App Inventor, various mobile Apps have been developed for the better learning of the kids. The learning of the impaired kids have been cleared explained by the special teachers to the developers. This made to develop Apps more clearly, concisely and perfectly. Different Apps were done keeping in the view of international standard of teaching to special kids who are hearing impaired. The Apps developed covered variety of topics such as Early Vocabulary,Vehicle and Voice Sounds, Syllable Length Word (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Discriminate Consonant, Same Length Words (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Leaning by Manner, Learning of Colors, Learning various Poems (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu) and explaining short Stories(in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu). The Apps have been done in both English and native languages too keeping in view of the therapy requested by the kid's parents. Tests are also included in the Apps to know the level of learning. During initial stages, suggestions were given by audiologists, special teachers and counselors. After continuous and rigorous reviews and feedbacks, the apps developed had become satisfactory to all the special trainers and was ready to use. They were given to the challenged kids for testing as a part of their learning. The results found by the teachers were astounding. Children are showing more interest to learn on mobile rather than book. The duration of attention  towards learning of the kid has drastically improved. Teachers training the special kids are very happy with this m-learning (Mobile learning). Parents too found it to be amazing as their kids show more interest towards learning through mobile. Also, now they are very much comfortable to train the kids at their homes by using these Apps. The parents are very excited to get all these learning Apps shared to their mobiles.  It  is a great feeling of satisfaction to see kids interested to learn and the parents with bright smile on their face. This all happened by developing learning Apps of open-source software. Over all it's an awesome experience !!</span></p>",

This gives rise to the need for heterogeneous computing.Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processor or cores. </span><span style=\"\">These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar co-processors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.</span><span style=\"\">There are a number of heterogeneous devices that are readily available off the shelf, some of them as commercially available system on chips (SoCs) and can be easily accessible to the average embedded software programmer. These heterogeneous devices incorporate hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The advantages of having multiple types of hardware accelerators within a system on chip are many, such as high-performance gains and specificity of tasks performed. One of the major issues is the exotic programming model that each hardware accelerator brings along with it. </span><span style=\"\">FPGAs bring along the requirement to write accelerators using hardware description language (HDL) at a very low level of abstraction (register transfer level) which has a really steep learning curve, extremely long compilation/place and route timings and are relatively difficult to debug. GPUs have their own programming languages and until a few years ago GPUs were used predominantly for graphics processing as the name suggests. However off late, with computing problems of large sizes and datasets, a lot of computations are being off-loaded to the GPU due to its benefit in parallel execution. </span><span style=\"\">Even with a great number of devices available, the difference in programming models makes it difficult to truly use all these devices in unison. </span><span style=\"\">Even with these multitudes of methods available for hardware acceleration, it is still not possible for software developers to adopt and use these devices as part of their daily routine for hardware acceleration. In order to achieve the full potential of hardware acceleration, multiple heterogeneous devices within the same SoC must be programmable using a single programming model and also the programming model must be portable across devices without loss of functionality. The aim of this talk is to throw light on the OpenCL(Open Computing Language API) and its potential for being the one single language that can be used to program multiple devices.</span></p>",

For many query, this is not the best way to optimize them: you need to rethink and rewrite them completely. To do this, you need to know how optimizer and executor work, and keep that in mind while composing your queries. In this talk, I will present an overview of a few less known and rarely used techniques such as:</span><span style=\"\">* using and implementing loose index scan for different scenarios;</span><span style=\"\">* using IOS in situation where it isn't applicable directly;</span><span style=\"\">* replacing IN (long list of values) with JOIN VALUES ();</span><span style=\"\">* moving a limit or offset clause inside joins;</span><span style=\"\">* and other tricks with row types and arrays of row types.</span><span style=\"\">Using these techniques and some other ideas, we will learn how to optimize a 'friends feed/subscription news' query, which is a typical task in many projects. We will diretcly compare performance of four different approaches: direct approach (simplest query), optimized direct approach (more complicated version of it), pl/pgsql with different algorithms, and implementation of this pl/plsql code in plain sql. I will show how this approach can convert almost any read-only non-dynamic (no EXECUTE statements and no exceptions) pl/pgsql code to a plain sql query.</span></p>",

Also, I founded a community,Edu.FOSS, with my best partner. It gathers a lot of source and power from professors at NCKU and outstanding friends of SLAT Association. Through it can not only promote FOSS, but also help children living in places lack of resources. Furthermore, we are promoting improvement in the CS education policy around the whole Taiwan.

Code Analysis Tools Implementation.2. Refactored and redesigned the app, Restructured the current codebase to support the Model-View-Presenter(MVP) architecture.3. Upgraded to latest stable libraries, e.g. Retrofit 2, Picasso, Dagger 2, etc.4. Writing unit tests to increase code coverage. A unit test was important we need to make sure future developments doesn't break the stable model layer.5. Offline content availability. Once we had the abstractions of MVP in place, I have implemented the Offline feature So field officer can sync the Clients data, make client, group, etc. offline and later on sync to the server. I have written the DatabaseHelper layer from scratch and implemented everything successfully in an abstract manner.6. I have made some breaking changes in an app such as Client Document, Identifier Upload, Client Survey, Offline Mode, Groups, Group, Client Sync, etc.I am actively contributing to this project. Also, I have assigned the code maintainer of the Mifos Android-Client and Mifos Self-Service.Here is my GSoC project link: <a href=\"https://github.com/openMF/android-client\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/openMF/android-client</a>.

So, is this true? Is there a mismatch between the designer and the community? Are there differences in participants' expectations?- Should the designer be involved in the project from the beginning to the end? - Should the designer be also a technical person? - Should the designer be responsible for the implementation of his proposals? - What we request in a design work is realistic and according to designer's specialty? - How can we evaluate a designer's proposals inside our community? - Can we have more than one designer involved in the community? - Do we know our target and provide full specifications when requesting design work? - Who should have the final decision on design proposals? - Is the designer responsible for all the usability problems of the project?- Why it is so easy to provide design feedback?- etc.All the above are valid questions when interacting with designers in open source communities and some times the answers don't match. Stating very clear what the expectations are can be helpful in having long term design contributions. In this presentation we will go over the common questions and expectations designers and open source communities have and try to provide a base for design work interactions.</p>",

MySQL released GA version of Group Replication plugin on Dec 12 2012 (MySQL 5.7.17).MySQL Group Replication provides distributed state machine replication with strong coordination between servers. Servers coordinate themselves automatically when they are part of the same group. The group can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time. Alternatively, for more advanced users the group can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued concurrently. There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of the group consistent and available for all servers at any given point in time.</p>",

Similarly, there is a huge selection of free professional-quality software, in particular (but not only) related to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Yet all too often, students are only taught to use computers for basic word processing or presentations and never learn to tap the computer’s power as a versatile problem-solving tool, even if it could be readily applied at school, in their future careers, and at home. In my presentation, I will demonstrate a few examples of free software we use routinely in our STEM teaching and research lab in areas such as computer-assisted mathematics, mechanical design, electronic circuit design, and data analysis.The ultimate key to take control of the computer as a tool is the ability to program it. The Python programming language is rightfully popular in education, academia and industry alike as it is easy to learn, yet extremely expressive and powerful. I will show examples of how we/our students use Python to simulate engineering designs before prototyping, control experiments, and acquire and process data.I will close by discussing why free software is not just about the money, and how some attractive-looking free-of-charge software or online service schemes can actually hurt students by taking their freedom away.<p></p>",

I was the lead Android developer of the team. I will be talking about how we worked with the government and will talk about five aspects of the app - Development, scalability, security, release and maintenance. I will talk about localization of apps as our app is currently targeting 10 regional languages in India with dynamic content. We had to get multiple security clearances from different government and private agencies due to the nature of the app which included automated source code testing, white boxtesting, blackbox testing and manual testing. Due to the expected high load on the app, we did multiple load tests on the app before launch to configure servers and load balancers. Finally I will talk about the release process of the app and the ongoing maintenance.Contest Details - <a href=\"http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details</a> about the release - <a href=\"https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1</a></p>",

        "short_abstract": "<p>Device drivers are essential components of anyoperating system (OS). They specify the communication protocol that allows the OS to interact with a device. However, drivers for new devices are usually created for a specific OS version. These drivers often need to be backported to the older versions to allow use of the new device. Backporting is often done manually, and is tedious and error prone. To alleviate this burden on developers, we propose an automatic recommendation system to guide the selection of backporting changes. Our approach analyzes the version history for cues to recommend candidate changes. We have performed an experiment on 100 Linux driver files and have shown that we can give a recommendation containing the correct backport for 68 of the drivers. For these 68 cases, 73.5%, 85.3%, and 88.2% of the correct recommendations are located in the Top-1, Top-2, and Top-5 positions of the recommendation lists respectively. The successful cases cover various kinds of changes including change of record access, deletion of function argument, change of a function name, change of constant, and change of if condition. Manual investigation of failed cases highlights limitations of our approach, including inability to infer complex changes, and unavailability of relevant cues in version history.

This talk aims at providing a brief overview of all the awesome features that are available as part of MySQL-5.7.They cover a lot of different technical areas, with special emphasis on: Usability/Online: Online Reconfiguration of “Global Transaction Identifiers”, Online reconfiguration of “Replication Filters” and Online fail over to a new master. Improved replication monitoring which is more flexible and user friendly.Performance: Improved “User threads – Sender threads” synchronization, Locking based parallelism, new “Ack Receiver” thread which makes “Semi – sync Replication” faster and a faster “Sender Thread”.Dependability: “Loss-less Semi – Sync Replication” and “Wait for multiple acks”.Flexibility: Storing “Global Transaction Identifiers” in a Table and “Multi – source Replication”.Moreover, development continues and the team already has some very interesting feature previews on labs, such as a new and exciting replication plugin: MySQL Group Replication. Seize the opportunity to get together with some of the engineers behind the product and learn about the exciting new replication world in MySQL 5.7 and beyond.</p>",

As these cities become increasingly complex systems of people and interconnected infrastructure, extreme weather events and long term environmental changes pose acute challenges for disaster response and humanitarian action.</span><span style=\"\">Although rapidly urbanizing environments are often thought to be “data scarce,” by enabling residents to share emergency data openly and in real time, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> makes a wealth of information available that promotes resilience to extreme weather events. By gathering, sorting, and visualizing data, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> transforms the noise of social and digital media into critical information for residents, communities, and government agencies. The platform adopts a  “people as sensors” paradigm, where confirmed reports are collected directly from the users at street level in a manner that removes expensive and time-consuming data processing. This framework creates accurate, real-time data which is immediately made available for users and first responders.</span><span style=\"\"> </span><span style=\"\">The CogniCity OSS was designed, tested, and deployed as an operational platform in Jakarta during a three-year (2013-2016) applied research project. As a “proof of platform,” the free web-based flood map <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> was used by hundreds of thousands of residents during monsoon flooding.

Additional CogniCity OSS modules are in development at the MIT Urban Risk Lab to address other hazards, including earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, typhoons, and terrorism. CogniCity OSS is also being designed to integrate and coordinate additional data sources, including various instant messaging services. And, as CogniCity OSS is deployed as a disaster risk management system in other Asian megacities, additional platform extensions and innovations will provide additional support for humanitarian response to urban disasters.</span></p>",

What's even better is that edk2 contains a sub-project, OVMF, to provide the firmware for QEMU, the virtual machine, we don't need a bare metal to implement features or debug hardware independent issues anymore.

Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!”</span><span style=\"\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Why is it an innovation?</span><span style=\"\">WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude, now almost forgotten by mankind, that led our civilisation to take the huge steps that have brought us here today, with our endless heritage of knowledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people, without the free availability of knowledge, no big discovery would have been possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the love for free knowledge, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. </span><span style=\"\">As volunteers, freely collaborating between us, we want to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profound and significant meaning, merging naturally with our philosophy.</span><span style=\"\">Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous development of the existing material, to the collaboration and communication among learners.</span><span style=\"\">Everything on WikiToLearn is freely accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available to everyone.</span><span style=\"\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"\">         </span><span style=\"\">Why should I contribute?</span><span style=\"\">It is really important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement of the contents.

You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educational path.</span><span style=\"\">The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organised way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.</span></li><li><span style=\"\">I’m a coder! - </span><span style=\"\">Do you want to help WikiToLearn \"under the hood\"?

        "short_abstract": "<p>The Shogun Machine learning toolbox provides a wide range of unified and efficient Machine Learning (ML) methods. The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine modern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing backends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.One of Shogun's most exciting features is that you can use the toolbox through a unified interface from C++, Python, Octave, R, Java, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc. This not just means that we are independent of trends in computing languages, but it also lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multiple communities. We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C++ and target languages. One of the focus point of the talk is the introduction of the meta-example framework developed as part of the toolbox: a user can write an example use-case for a method using our 'meta-example' syntax, that would then be auto-translated into all of the supported languages of the library. This not only allows us to easily scale with the number of new methods in the sense of having the example use-cases of the method being exposed to all of the target languages, but it allows us to have those methods tested throughout of all the languages.Originally focussing on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics, the toolbox saw massive extensions to other fields in recent years. It now offers features that span the whole space of Machine Learning methods, including many classical methods in classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric, multi-task, structured output, and online learning, as well as feature hashing, ensemble methods, and optimization, just to name a few. Shogun in addition contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as a wealth of efficient SVM implementations, Multiple Kernel Learning, kernel hypothesis testing, Krylov methods, etc. All algorithms are supported by a collection of general purpose methods for evaluation, parameter tuning, preprocessing, serialisation &amp; I/O, etc; the resulting combinatorial possibilities are huge.</p>",

It can be seen as an extension of NLTK, but with special consideration for the unique needs of historical languages. It provides basic functions for many languages (e.g., n-grams, word frequencies, word tokenization) and wider support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text normalization, sentence tokenizer, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). We plan to extend to other languages, as well.</span><span style=\"\">The CLTK Archive is a website I worked on during my GSoC project. It's a web app front-end to the CLTK core and also provides a modern reading environment for interacting with ancient texts. The Archive aims to provide an aesthetically-pleasing yet utilitarian environment that facilitates reading, note taking, and learning. It presents Classical texts in an easy-to-read layout with metadata like translation, commentary, and word definitions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides access to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package. </span><span style=\"\">I will also be giving a short demos of the capabilities of the Python library and CLTK Archive website (available soon as an alpha release).</span></p>",
